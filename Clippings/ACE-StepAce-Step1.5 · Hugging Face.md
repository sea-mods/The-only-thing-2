## Model Details

🚀 **ACE-Step v1.5** is a highly efficient open-source music foundation model designed to bring commercial-grade music generation to consumer hardware.

### Key Features

- **💰 Commercial-Ready:** Unlike many models trained on ambiguous datasets, ACE-Step v1.5 is designed for creators. You can strictly use the generated music for **commercial purposes**.
- **📚 Safe & Robust Training Data:** The model is trained on a massive, legally compliant dataset consisting of:
	- **Licensed Data:** Professionally licensed music tracks.
	- **Royalty-Free / No-Copyright Data:** A vast collection of public domain and royalty-free music.
	- **Synthetic Data:** High-quality audio generated via advanced MIDI-to-Audio conversion.
- **⚡ Extreme Speed:** Generates a full song in under 2 seconds on an A100 and under 10 seconds on an RTX 3090.
- **🖥️ Consumer Hardware Friendly:** Runs locally with less than 4GB of VRAM.

### Technical Capabilities

🌉 At its core lies a novel hybrid architecture where the Language Model (LM) functions as an omni-capable planner: it transforms simple user queries into comprehensive song blueprints—scaling from short loops to 10-minute compositions—while synthesizing metadata, lyrics, and captions via Chain-of-Thought to guide the Diffusion Transformer (DiT). ⚡ Uniquely, this alignment is achieved through intrinsic reinforcement learning relying solely on the model's internal mechanisms, thereby eliminating the biases inherent in external reward models or human preferences. 🎚️

🔮 Beyond standard synthesis, ACE-Step v1.5 unifies precise stylistic control with versatile editing capabilities—such as cover generation, repainting, and vocal-to-BGM conversion—while maintaining strict adherence to prompts across 50+ languages. This paves the way for powerful tools that seamlessly integrate into the creative workflows of music artists, producers, and content creators. 🎸

- **Developed by:** \[ACE-STEP\]
- **Model type:** \[Text2Music\]
- **Language(s):** \[50+ languages\]
- **License:** \[MIT\]
